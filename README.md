# ðŸ§  DeepSeek Fine-Tuning Framework

This repository provides a lightweight pipeline for fine-tuning [DeepSeek](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai) and other instruction-tuned LLMs using curated, token-efficient datasets. At present, it's intended for learning.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Shard-based streaming dataloaders (e.g. 10B Token Sample of `FineWeb-EDU`)
- âœ… Efficient tokenization using `tiktoken` (OpenAI-compatible)
- âœ… Multiprocessing-backed data preprocessing
- âœ… Support for 8-bit optimizer checkpoints
- âœ… Ready for long-context causal LM training
